        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
            In a small workshop nestled in the heart of Kabul, a group of skilled artisans gathers every day to create traditional Afghan clothing. Their hands move swiftly, weaving vibrant threads into intricate patterns that tell stories of culture, history, and identity.

This group specializes in crafting firaq (traditional dresses for women) and perahan tunban (tunics and trousers for men), using fabrics like silk and cotton. The garments are adorned with dazzling embroidery, mirror work, and bead designs, reflecting the rich diversity of Afghan traditions.

Beyond preserving cultural heritage, this dressmaking group empowers women by providing them with stable income and a platform to showcase their artistry. Their creations are not just clothes—they're symbols of resilience and pride, sold in local markets and occasionally reaching international fashion showcases.

Through their dedication, this group proves that Afghan craftsmanship continues to thrive, carrying the essence of its heritage to the world.
